We have deprecated the old, outdated wiki and tutorial, and updated links on this site to point to the proper ReadTheDocs page. If you are new to using the Gadgetron, please be wary of using any tutorial content or templates that are older than approximately 2020 - there have been major changes to the recommended Gadget architecture and development process. If you have any questions while getting started, consider asking a question on the project's [Discourse forum](https://gadgetron.discourse.group/).
